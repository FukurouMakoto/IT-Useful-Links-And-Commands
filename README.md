# IT-Useful-Links-And-Commands
A repository for useful commands, links, programs and procedures for IT work.
Many of these will serve only fringe use cases, but work well enough for what they do that I would like to make note of them. 

Items included:

## Commands

Will include MSDOS commands, Powershell commands, and Bash commands.

## Links

Useful articles that help to teach IT concepts, documentation for programs, and other such things.
